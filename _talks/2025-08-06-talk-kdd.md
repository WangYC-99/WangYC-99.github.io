A solution-based LLM API-using methodology for academic information seeking, which is named SoAy.  It uses code with a solution as the reasoning method, where a solution is a pre-constructed API calling sequence. 
The addition of the solution reduces the difficulty for the model to understand the complex relationships between APIs. Code improves the efficiency of reasoning.
To evaluate SoAy, we introduce SoAyBench, an evaluation benchmark accompanied by SoAyEval, built upon a cloned environment of APIs from AMiner.
