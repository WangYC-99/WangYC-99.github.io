I am a Ph.D. student at the School of Information, Renmin University of China, under supervision of [Jing Zhang](https://xiaojingzi.github.io/). 
At the same time, I'm an intern at KEG of Tsinghua University and ZHIPU AI, under supervision of [Jifan Yu](https://yujifan0326.github.io/). 
Privious to that, I graduated from [Honors College](https://honors.nwpu.edu.cn/) of Northwestern Polytechnical University, where I majored in Computer Science. 
Currently, my research focuses on Tool Intelligence of LLMs and AI for Education.
